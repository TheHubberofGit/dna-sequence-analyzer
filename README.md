# DNA Sequence Analyzer

The code takes in an input of a DNA Sequence, and removes all whitespaces, tabs, and newlines.
From there, the code outputs the sequence itself, the string length, the Adenine count, the Cytosine count,
the Thymine count, and the Guanine count, along with the GC percentage and count for unknown proteins.

## How to use it:
1. Input your DNA sequence into the sample_dna.txt file (whitespaces, tabs, and newlines are okay).
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. run py DNA_Analysis.py.

Sample Output:
- ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTN
- The length of the DNA string is: 20
- The A count is: 5
- The C count is: 5
- The T count is: 5
- The G count is: 4
- The GC percentage is: 45.0%
- The count of unknowns is: 1
